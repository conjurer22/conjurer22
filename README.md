- 👋 Hi, I’m @conjurer22
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision applications in medicine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web apps focused on computer vision and machine learning.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I quit medicine to code and have an actual life instead of being an overworked insufferable douche with a false God-complex.
